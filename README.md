# Repository of React Native Apps

I made these apps while creating two App Development with React Native curriculums in my stint at TinkerTanker. 

My first project was to create a curriculum for a [React Native SMU Academy (Professional Certificate) module](https://academy.smu.edu.sg/introduction-mobile-app-development-4051). 

Then, for my second project, I adapted it to a more schools-based approach, meant to introduce secondary to JC students with little to no programming background to app development.

I made step-by-step instructions in slides for students to follow the lesson, as well as starter code to help them save lesson time. 

Feel free to check out demos of each app in its respective folders.
